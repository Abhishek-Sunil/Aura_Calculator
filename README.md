### Project Description
wanna find your "‡¥§‡µá‡¥ú‡¥∏‡µç‚Äå"!?,Here we introduce our AURA CALCULATOR to calculate your daily life Aura

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever feel like your vibe could use a little more... vibe? Or maybe you're just curious if helping that old lady cross the street earns you more cosmic points than that time you totally nailed a backflip in front of your friends. In a world where good deeds and cringe moments fly by unnoticed, there's no fun way to keep track of how our actions add up. Sure, we all want to be good people (most of the time), but where‚Äôs the scoreboard? How do you know if spilling coffee on your shirt knocked down your cool factor or if saving your friend from a bad joke earned you bonus points?




### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter the Aura Calculator: the fun and quirky way to measure the ups and downs of your daily actions. It's like a karma meter, but with a twist‚Äînow you can see how your good deeds, awkward mishaps, and epic wins shape your aura score, all while having a good laugh along the way.
